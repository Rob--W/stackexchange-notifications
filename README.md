This Chrome extension provides real-time desktop notifications for notifications for the Stack Exchange.

After installing the extension, set the user ID, and you will get a desktop notification if a new message has been received.

I did not upload it to the Chrome Web Store (yet). To use the extension, download the files, and load the extension in Developer mode at `chrome://extensions/`.
