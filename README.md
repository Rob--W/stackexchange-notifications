This extension provides [real-time desktop notifications for Stack Exchange's inbox](https://stackapps.com/q/3780/9699?real-time-desktop-notifications-for-stack-exchange-inbox-chrome-extension).

## Chrome extension
After installing the extension, visit Options and click on the "Grant Token"
button. Upon click, a Stack Exchange authentication dialog will open. Grant
the token, and the extension will autofill the user ID. Then, you will
immediately get notified of the unread message count in your inbox.

(Alternatively, you can manually set the user ID, but then the extension will
not be able to count the number of unread messages.)

## Firefox add-on
The extension has been ported to a Firefox add-on since version 1.5!  
Install it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/real-time-desktop-notificat/

The add-on can be configured by clicking on the StackExchange icon in the main toolbar or in the
[add-on bar](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons)
(located at the bottom of Firefox's window).

The add-on is optimized for use with XUL notifications, and attempts to keep the
notification around until the user (you) explicitly dismisses the notification.
If your Firefox uses native notifications, but you prefer XUL notifications,
install https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/no-native-notifications/
to get XUL notifications instead of native notifications.
