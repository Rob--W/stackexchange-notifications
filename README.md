## Firefox add-on
The extension has been ported to a Firefox add-on since version 1.5!  
Install it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/real-time-desktop-notificat/

The add-on can be configured by clicking on the StackExchange icon at the [add-on bar](http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons) (located at the bottom of Firefox's window). If you don't see this bar, press `Ctrl` + `/` to show it.
