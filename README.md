This extension provides [real-time desktop notifications for Stack Exchange's inbox](https://stackapps.com/q/3780/9699?real-time-desktop-notifications-for-stack-exchange-inbox-chrome-extension).

## Chrome extension
After installing the extension, visit Options and click on the "Grant Token"
button. Upon click, a Stack Exchange authentication dialog will open. Grant
the token, and the extension will autofill the user ID. Then, you will
immediately get notified of the unread message count in your inbox.

(Alternatively, you can manually set the user ID, but then the extension will
not be able to count the number of unread messages.)
